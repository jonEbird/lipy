This project is about providing the init scripts for the 3rd party, add-on daemons or applications to your servers. Often times, init scripts are non-existent for products you support as a system administrator. This is particularly true for in-house applications, where the product development team pushes off the support of the OS init scripts to the system administrators.

This project provides a way to have a single, python based script to support any add on daemons/application in respect to their RC script requirements. Configuration data is stored centrally in a LDAP server.

The end result is a consistent, predictable server environment for all of your various support level personnel.
